Whew! This project took me about 5 days to complete. I'm proud that I was able to make it all work, for the most part, but I still have much to improve.

## Learning Notes:
- I am getting more comfortable with CSS Grid.
- JS DOM functions are starting to stick in my head.
- I need to get better at planning before trying to execute. I knew ahead of time that I was going to want to impliment both button click input and keyboard input, however I didn't plan accordingly, and now my JS is hard to read and manage.

### Things to Improve:
- I forgot to add a way to switch between positive and negative input until I got to the design stage. By that time, I was JavaScripted out.
- I wanted to add a custom font to make the number output appear like the numbers on an LCD screen, but I couldn't figure it out.
- I'm sure a more talented person than me can refactor the JS into something DRYer.
- There's still a lot of CSS I can learn to make my project look better and act more responsively.
